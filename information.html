        Nutritionists use ideas from molecular biology, biochemistry, and
        genetics to understand how nutrients affect the human body. Nutrition
        also focuses on how people can use dietary choices to reduce the risk of
        disease, what happens if a person has too much or too little of a
        nutrient, and how allergies work. Nutrients provide nourishment.
        Proteins, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water are
        all nutrients. If people do not have the right balance of nutrients in
        their diet, their risk of developing certain health conditions
        increases. This article will explain the different nutrients a person
        needs and why. It will also look at the role of the dietitian and the
        nutritionist.

      <div id="carbs" class="info-par background-img">
        <h4>Carbohydrates</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Sugars</strong> are simple carbs. The body quickly breaks down
          and absorbs sugars and processed starch. They can provide rapid
          energy, but they do not leave a person feeling full. They can also
          cause a spike in blood sugar levels. Frequent sugar spikes increase
          the risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fiber</strong> is also a carbohydrate. The body breaks down
          some types of fiber and uses them for energ; others are metabolized by
          gut bacteria, while other types pass through the body. Fiber and
          unprocessed starch are complex carbs. It takes the body some time to
          break down and absorb complex carbs. After eating fiber, a person will
          feel full for longer. Fiber may also reduce the risk of diabetes,
          cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer. Complex carbs are a
          more healthful choice than sugars and refined carbs.

      <div id="protein" class="info-par background-img">
        <h4>Proteins</h4>
        <p>
          Proteins consist of amino acids, which are organic compounds that
          occur naturally. There are 20 amino acids. Some of these are
          essential, which means people need to obtain them from food. The body
          can make the others. Some foods provide complete protein, which means
          they contain all the essential amino acids the body needs. Other foods
          contain various combinations of amino acids. Most plant-based foods do
          not contain complete protein, so a person who follows a vegan diet
          needs to eat a range of foods throughout the day that provides the
          essential amino acids.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="fats" class="info-par background-img">
        <h4>Fats</h4>
        <p>
          Fats are essential for: lubricating joints helping organs produce
          hormones enabling the body to absorb certain vitamins reducing
          inflammation preserving brain health Too much fat can lead to obesity,
          high cholesterol, liver disease, and other health problems. However,
          the type of fat a person eats makes a difference. Unsaturated fats,
          such as olive oil, are more healthful than saturated fats, which tend
          to come from animals.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="water" class="info-par background-img">
        <h4>water</h4>

        <p>
          The adult human body is up to 60% water, and it needs water for many
          processes. Water contains no calories, and it does not provide energy.
          Many people recommend consuming 2 liters, or 8 glasses, of water a
          day, but it can also come from dietary sources, such as fruit and
          vegetables. Adequate hydration will result in pale yellow urine.
          Requirements will also depend on an individual’s body size and age,
          environmental factors, activity levels, health status, and so on.

        physical activity is any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles
        that requires energy expenditure. Physical activity refers to all
        movement including during leisure time, for transport to get to and from
        places, or as part of a person’s work. Both moderate- and
        vigorous-intensity physical activity improve health. Popular ways to be
        active include walking, cycling, wheeling, sports, active recreation and
        play, and can be done at any level of skill and for enjoyment by
        everybody. Regular physical activity is proven to help prevent and
        manage noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes
        and several cancers. It also helps prevent hypertension, maintain
        healthy body weight and can improve mental health, quality of life and
        well-being.

          should do at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic
          physical activity; or at least 75–150 minutes of vigorous-intensity
          aerobic physical activity; or an equivalent combination of moderate-
          and vigorous-intensity activity throughout the week should also do
          muscle-strengthening activities at moderate or greater intensity that
          involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these
          provide additional health benefits. may increase moderate-intensity
          aerobic physical activity to more than 300 minutes; or do more than
          150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity; or an
          equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity
          throughout the week for additional health benefits. should limit the
          amount of time spent being sedentary. Replacing sedentary time with
          physical activity of any intensity (including light intensity)
          provides health benefits, and to help reduce the detrimental effects
          of high levels of sedentary behaviour on health, all adults and older
          adults should aim to do more than the recommended levels of moderate-
          to vigorous-intensity physical activity

        <h4>Risks and benefits</h4>
        <p>
          Regular physical activity, such as walking, cycling, wheeling, doing
          sports or active recreation, provides significant benefits for health.
          Some physical activity is better than doing none. By becoming more
          active throughout the day in relatively simple ways, people can easily
          achieve the recommended activity levels. Physical inactivity is one of
          the leading risk factors for noncommunicable diseases mortality.
          People who are insufficiently active have a 20% to 30% increased risk
          of death compared to people who are sufficiently active. Regular
          physical activity can:

        <h4>How to get better</h4>
        <p>
          Countries and communities must take action to provide everyone with
          more opportunities to be active, in order to increase physical
          activity. This requires a collective effort, both national and local,
          across different sectors and disciplines to implement policy and
          solutions appropriate to a country’s cultural and social environment
          to promote, enable and encourage physical activity. Policies to
          increase physical activity aim to ensure that: walking, cycling and
          other forms of active non-motorized forms of transport are accessible
          and safe for all; labour and workplace policies encourage active
          commuting and opportunities for being physically active during the
          work day; childcare, schools and higher education institutions provide
          supportive and safe spaces and facilities for all students to spend
          their free time actively; primary and secondary schools provide
          quality physical education that supports children to develop behaviour
          patterns that will keep them physically active throughout their lives;
          community-based and school-sport programmes provide appropriate
          opportunities for all ages and abilities; sports and recreation
          facilities provide opportunities for everyone to access and
          participate in a variety of different sports, dance, exercise and
          active recreation; and health care providers advise and support
          patients to be regularly active.
